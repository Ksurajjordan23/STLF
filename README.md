Electrical load forecasting using ML 
Electrical load forecasting using ML Electrical Energy (EE) is a major requirement of our daily modern lives. All basic gadgets and devices from a toaster to an electric car run on electrical energy. Significance of this form of energy is not just on a small scale but also impacts on nationwide social and economic development. This has brought forward the issue of being efficient with energy consumption involving using Renewable Energy and Energy Management. When it comes to households and grids, a really robust technique called as Short Term Load Forecasting (STLF) has emerged as an energy management method. Knowledge of the future electricity demands can helps us not only improving the energy system scheduling but also reducing the operation costs. This is why STLF plays a major role in smart grids, power availability and load management. In this study, we will see how we can implement STLF on Active and Reactive Power data of 74 residential households using Neural Networks (NN) and different Linear Models (LM) in Machine Learning (ML). Accuracy of STLF was compared using different LM in terms of RMSE (Root Mean Square Error).
